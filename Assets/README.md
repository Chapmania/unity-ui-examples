# Offest UI
![Example demo gif](https://github.com/LewisJohnson/unity-ui-examples/blob/master/Assets/Offset/readme-gif.gif)
This UI is inspired by games such as No Man's Sky and Destiny, where the UI offsets to the Joystick/Mouse movement.

### Supported aspect ratios
* 5:4
* 4:3
* 3:2
* 16:10
* 16:9

### Parameters

  * X Clamp Max - The clamp on the offset of the container's local x position.
  * Y Clamp Max - The clamp on the offset of the container's local y position.
  * Blackbar Percentage - The percentage of black bar covering the screen. 25% would be 50% of the screen covered, because there is a top and bottom bar.
